Federated Clustering Algorithm based on a Fuzzy Clustering Feature Vector


##ABSTRACT
The availability of a large amount of data produced in multiple devices and organizations provides great opportunities and challenges. A great amount of this data is privacy-sensitive and thus, sending it to a central server is not convenient. Furthermore, this data can have different characteristics in different producers making a unique globalized model not the best choice for its processing. Federated Learning is a concept developed to overcome these problems, through a local parameter learning step and a posterior parameter
sharing step which does not involve sharing the data. In this work, a Federated Clustering algorithm is proposed. This algorithm is based on Fuzzy Cluster Feature vectors which can manage the uncertainty of points belonging to a certain cluster. The preliminary experimental results show that the proposal is equivalent to other State of The Art methods while requiring fewer communication rounds.
